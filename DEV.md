All development was done with Claude
It messed up with a couple of things:
- testcontainers
- docker images are not available
- GHA workflow was a mess
- docker compose - old way
- i did not spot the missing docker images :D 
- Claude essentially make some flow draft that I have to rewrite, not very effective approach :/
